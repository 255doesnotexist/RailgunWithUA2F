### If anything goes wrong...

If you think there's something wrong in my builds, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/KevinMX/Railgun/issues/new/choose). No annoying templates needed. Just remember to leave enough information (how to reproduce, necessary logs, etc) here. Nobody like guess your problem and come up with a solution out of no where :)

If you think the issue is from upstream projects, please open issues there.
